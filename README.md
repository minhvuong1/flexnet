## Development
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Ruby
4. Sinatra
5. PostGreSQL
6. Heroku

I started by sketching page structures, layouts, SQL tables that I needed to use on a whiteboard in order for the app to function correctly. I started by designing the page through VSCode using Embed Ruby in HTML, CSS and Javascript. Throughout
the 3 days of development I used "pry" and "sinatra/reloader" to help the debugging stages be much more straightfoward. All the data is stored in the SQL by using Ruby to
manipulate data and display to the browser. Bcypt is a library that was also used allowing to easily store a secure hash of all users' passwords. The application is deployed by Heroku. Here is the link:
